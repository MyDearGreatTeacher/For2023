This use case will deal with an attack on an ICS/SCADA environment in the energy sector. The successful
completion of this scenario will teach the students how to set up and configure a network security
monitoring environment, including the baselining of regular (non-malicious) traffic and finally, the successful
analysis of a multi-stage attack on the network. During the exercise, the students will have to deal with a
previously unseen network architecture and to familiarise themselves with an unknown protocol used to
