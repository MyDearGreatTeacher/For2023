- 三個案例分析
- 案例1:能源領域 ICS/SCADA 攻擊流量分析
  - 鑑識情境
    - 此案例將處理對能源領域 ICS/SCADA 攻擊流量分析
    - 此案例將教導學生如何設定和配置網路安全監控環境，包括常規（非惡意）流量的基線(the baselining of regular (non-malicious) traffic)，最後成功分析網路上的多階段攻擊。
    - 在練習過程中，學生將必須處理以前未見過的網路架構，並熟悉用於控制工業環境的未知協議

One of the threats that IT security teams are facing in almost every corporation environment is a risk of
internal data being stolen and exfiltrated to third party servers. This might lead to many legal problems,
huge fines, loss of reputation or disclosing company secrets and strategic documents.
Typically, data exfiltration can be done using various approaches and techniques. From the attacker point of
view, it is important to evade detection for as long as possible. Thus, attackers must balance between
exfiltration speed and using often slower but more concealed techniques.
This section consists of two parts covering two different approaches to data exfiltration. In the first part
students will learn how to use web proxy logs and other security systems to detect exfiltration over HTTP(s)
channel. In this part students will learn:
 How to install and configure web proxy with TLS/SSL traffic interception capability,
 How to use Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) to aid analysis,
 How to perform web proxy logs analysis.
The second part covers slightly more concealed and less common approach to data exfiltration using DNS
protocol when exfiltrated data is encoded among DNS queries. In this part students will learn:
 How to perform basic statistical analysis,
 How to search for anomalous DNS queries in often huge DNS log files.
