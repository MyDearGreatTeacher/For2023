## 核心技術
- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)


### CH5.Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
- DPI is the process of looking beyond the generic TCP/IP headers and involves analyzing the payload itself.
- DPI is widely used in the following fields and services:
  - Traffic shapers: Blocking malicious traffic/limiting traffic.
  - Service assurance: Network admins can ensure that high-priority traffic is carefully dealt with and services do not go down for them.
  - Identification of fake applications: Applications that make use of non-standard ports to leverage standard protocol data are easily identified with DPI.
  - Malware Detection: Since DPI allows viewing the payload itself, malware detection is much easier to perform.
  - Intrusion detection: Not only malware, but also the DPI-enabled system can uncover hack attempts and exploit attempts, backdoors, and much more.
  - Data Leakage Prevention (DLP): With DPI, we can identify critical data traveling out of the network as well, making it an ideal choice for DLP systems.
